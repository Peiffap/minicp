Learning outcomes by studying mini-cp:

From a state and inference prospective, specific learning outcomes include:

* Trailing and state reversion
* Domain and variable implementation â€“ Propagation queue
* Arithmetic Constraints
* Logical Constraints
* Reified Constraints
* Global Constraints
* Views


While, from a search prospective, the outcomes include:

* Backtracking algorithms and depth first search
* Branch and Bound for Constraint Optimization
* Incremental Computation
* Variable and Value Heuristics implementation
* Searching with phases
* Large Neighborhood Search

Mini-CP XCSP3 Mini Solver
******************************

We provide under the form of a student project the possibility to participate to the XCSP3 MiniSolver Competition with Mini-CP.
All the interfacing with XCSP3 tools and the parsing of XCSP3 format is done for you.
You can focus on the only interesting part: make your solver as efficient as possible.

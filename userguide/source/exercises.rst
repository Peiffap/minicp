Exercises
******************************

We propose a set of exercises to extend mini-cp with useful features.
By doing these exercises you will gradually progress in your understanding of CP.
For each exercise, we ask you to implement JUnit tests to make sure that
your implementation works as expected.
If you don't test each feature independently you take the risk to
loose a lot of time finding very difficult bugs.


Learning Outcomes
=======================================

Be able to

* Understand reversible data structures
* Understand a domain
* Implement global constraints
* Implement custom search
* Model CP easy problems
* Use LNS
* Write unit-tests for constraints and models
* Debug constraints, models, etc



Less or equal reified constraint
=================================

Implement `IsLessOrEqual.java <https://bitbucket.org/pschaus/minicp/src/HEAD/src/main/java/minicp/engine/constraints/IsLessOrEqual.java?at=master>`_

This is a reified constraint for `b iff x <= c`
that is boolean variable `b` is set true if and only if `x` variable is less or equal to value `c`.

For example the constraint holds for

.. code-block:: java

    b = true , x = 4, c = 5
    b = false, x = 4, c = 2


but is violated for

.. code-block:: java

    b = true , x = 5, c = 4
    b = false, x = 2, c = 4


Check that your implementation passes the tests `IsLessOrEqualTest.java <https://bitbucket.org/pschaus/minicp/src/HEAD/src/test/java/minicp/engine/constraints/IsEqualTest.java?at=master>`_


Element constraint
=================================


Implement `Element1D.java <https://bitbucket.org/pschaus/minicp/src/HEAD/src/main/java/minicp/engine/constraints/Element1D.java?at=master>`_


Two possibilities:

1. extends `Element2D` and reformulate `Element1D` as an `Element2D` constraint in super call of the constructor.
2. implement a dedicated algo (propagate, etc) for `Element1D` by taking inspiration from `Element2D`.

An element constraint is to index an array `T` by an index variable `x` and link the result with a variable `z`.
More exactly the relation `T[x]=z` must hold.

Assuming `T=[1,3,5,7,3]`, the constraint holds for

.. code-block:: java

    x = 1, z = 3
    x = 3, z = 7


but is violated for

.. code-block:: java

    x = 0, z = 2
    x = 3, z = 3


Check that your implementation passes the tests `Element1DTest.java <https://bitbucket.org/pschaus/minicp/src/HEAD/src/test/java/minicp/engine/constraints/Element1DTest.java?at=master>`_


Circuit Constraint
========================

The circuit constraint enforces an hamiltonian circuit on a successor array.
On the next example the successor array is `[2,4,1,5,3,0]`

.. image:: _static/circuit.svg
    :scale: 50
    :width: 250
    :alt: Circuit


All the successors must be different.
but enforcing the `allDifferent` constraint is not enough.
We must also guarantee it forms a proper circuit (without sub-tours).
This can be done efficiently and incrementally by keeping track of the sub-chains
in appearing the search.
The data-structure for the sub-chains should be a reversible.
Our instance variables used to keep track of the sub-chains are:

.. code-block:: java

    IntVar [] x;
    ReversibleInt [] dest;
    ReversibleInt [] orig;
    ReversibleInt [] lengthToDest;



* `dest[i]` is the furthest node we can reach from node `i` following the instantiated edges.
* `orig[i]` is the furthest node we can reach from node `i` following instantiated edges in reverse direction.
* `lengthToDest[i]` is the number of instantiated on the path from node `i` to `dest[i]`.

Consider the following example with instantiated edges colored in grey.

.. image:: _static/circuit-subtour.svg
    :scale: 50
    :width: 250
    :alt: Circuit

Before the addition of the green link we have

.. code-block:: java

    dest = [2,1,2,5,5,5];
    orig = [0,1,0,4,4,4];
    lengthToDest = [1,0,0,1,2,0];

After the addition of the green link we have

.. code-block:: java

    dest = [2,1,2,2,2,2];
    orig = [4,1,4,4,4,4];
    lengthToDest = [1,0,0,3,4,2];


In your implementation you must update the reversible integers to reflect
the change after the addition of every new edge.
You can use the `CPIntVar.whenBind(...)` method for that.

The filtering in itself consists in preventing to close a
sub-tour that would have a length less than `n` (the number of nodes).
Since node 4 has a length to destination (node 2) of 4 (<6), the destination node 2 can not have 4 as successor
and the red link is deleted.
This filtering was introduced in [TSP1998]_ for solving the TSP with CP.
